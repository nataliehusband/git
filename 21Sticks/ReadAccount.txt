The purpose of this program is to allow the user to make an account. 
When they do this, their information will be saved in a file and 
then later accessed when they log on so that if they enter the wrong
information, they will not be able to log in. Then, they will be prompted
to either play the game 21 sticks or to view the game standings. If they 
choose the game, they will be able to play. If they win or lose will be 
saved in the file GameStandings. Then they will be able to go back and 
choose to see the game standings, which will display how many times 
the user has won and how many times the computer has won. This is in a 
JFrame which will prompt the user to either return the the game, or 
to quit the game. This is the extent of the program.
